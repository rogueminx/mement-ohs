#### Plans for how to improve post Epicodus.
1. Attend a meet-up at least every other week. Focusing on women who code, and ruby-brigade.
2. Practice white-boarding every other day for 30-60 minutes on Edabit.
3. Get AWS certification
4. Host my portfolio and Mement-oh on their own URL.
5. Contact and meet coders recommended by Kyle with the goal of finding a mentor.
6. Investigate 3-D printing, and the software used to to print 3-D models. Find out what tech and languages are used.
7. Finish building out the mement-oh site.  
8. Make a Rails Api that uses data from Greater Schools to pinpoint schools that are in need of better funding.
