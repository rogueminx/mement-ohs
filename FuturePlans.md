# Post Epicodus


## Plans for how to improve post Epicodus.
#### High Priority
1. Attend a meet-up every week until I find a job. Focusing on women who code, and ruby-brigade.
2. Host my portfolio and mement-oh on their own URL.
3. Practice white-boarding every  day for 30-60 minutes on Edabit until I find a job. Alternate between Ruby and JS
4. Find a mentor. Start by contacting and meeting coders recommended by Kyle.
5. Follow up with people I meet at meet-ups and add them to Linked In.

#### Medium Priority
1. Get AWS certification
2. Volunteer to make a website for a non-profit or friend using Ruby/Rails
3. Build out a full shopping cart for a website (maybe in the one I volunteer to build.)

#### Low Priority





6. Investigate 3-D printing, and the software used to to print 3-D models. Find out what tech and languages are used.
7. Finish building out the mement-oh site.  
8. Make a Rails Api that uses data from Greater Schools to pinpoint schools that are in need of better funding.  
9. Use the Rails API with a different front end. Possibly Angular.
10. Add ability to add comments to blog posts on my portfolio site. Possibly switch to bulma for styling.
11. Add token authentication to Mement-oh
12. Add a new project to my portfolio every month. Make the first couple simpler Javascript applications since none are represented.  
13. Find a new language to start learning. Python?
