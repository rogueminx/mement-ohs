# Post Epicodus

My plan upon graduating from Epicodus is to spend every other day focused on coding (I'll have to start working my old job some to get an income). I will focus on prioritizing networking since that is one of the things that I find hardest. When I am not networking I will focus on the medium priority tasks to increase my skills and comforts.


## Plans for how to improve post Epicodus.
#### High Priority (rating on left 10 high, 1 is low)

10 - Finish building out the mement-oh site.
10 - Host my portfolio and mement-oh on their own URL.
9 - Attend a meet-up every week until I find a job. Focusing on women who code, and ruby-brigade.
9 - Practice white-boarding every  day for 30-60 minutes on Edabit until I find a job. Alternate between Ruby and JS
8 - Find a mentor. Start by contacting and meeting coders recommended by Kyle.
8 - Follow up with people I meet at meet-ups, add them to Linked In, and send message.

#### Medium Priority
7 - Make a Rails Api that uses data from Greater Schools to pinpoint schools that are in need of better funding.
7 - Use the Rails API with a different front end. Possibly Angular.
6 - Add a new project to my portfolio at least every month. Make the first couple simpler Javascript applications since none are represented.
6 - Get AWS certification
6 - Volunteer to make a website for a non-profit or friend using Ruby/Rails
6 - Build out a full shopping cart for a website (maybe in the one I volunteer to build.)
6 - Add ability to add comments to blog posts on my portfolio site. Possibly switch to bulma for styling.
5 - Investigate 3-D printing, and the software used to to print 3-D models. Find out what tech and languages are used.

#### Low Priority
5 - Find a new language to start learning. Python?
5 - Continue to meet up with key classmates to work on projects and have study time.
4 - Read and research more about machine-learning (also available through Amazon)
3 - Add token authentication to Mement-oh
3 -  Volunteer to help at Women Who Code.
3 - Learn more about Lumberjack.
