# Post Epicodus

My plan upon graduating from Epicodus is to spend every other day focused on coding (I'll have to start working my old job some to get an income). I will focus on prioritizing networking since that is one of the things that I find hardest. When I am not networking I will focus on the medium priority tasks to increase my skills and comforts.


## Plans for how to improve post Epicodus.
